Think of this less like a portfolio

Take a tour through the repos — some might surprise you others might look baseless. Apologies in advance if the code looks like it was written during an existential crisis (it probably was 😬).
Penitential contrition if my "Read me" files are messy 🙏 — I can read everything… except what I just read 🤷‍♂️.

I’m learning… and hopefully getting better at it each time 🚀.
