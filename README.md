# Life, uh… finds a way. And so does Adil !

Think of this less like a portfolio and more like a behind-the-scenes of an engineer still figuring things out.  

Take a tour through the repos — some might surprise you, others might horrify you. Apologies in advance if the code looks like it was written during an existential crisis (it probably was).
Penitential contrition if my "Read me" files are bad, I can read everything except what I just read.

I’m learning, I’m building, I’m breaking things… and hopefully getting better at it each time.
